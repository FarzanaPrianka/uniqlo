                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Uniqlo is a Japanese clothing retailer and manufacturer reknown for its affordable and
                        comfortable
                        product line. Ever since I came to Canada, I have been very fond of their clothings. I am
                        usually
                        Uniqlo's in-store shopper. But since the pandemic hits, I have been avoiding all in-store
                        visit
                        and switched to online shopping . Couple of months ago, I tried to use Uniqlo's iOS app for
                        the
                        first
                        time to order some activewear. As a user, I found the user interface difficult to
                        navigate
                        and as a designer , I found many flaws. To soothe my designer soul, I wanted to dig deeper
                        and
                        take
                        the opportunity to redesign the user interface.
                    </p>
                    <p class="emphasize">
                        The project is unsolicited and the goal was to identify any
                        usability issues and facilitate a better
                        user experience for Uniqlo's iOS app.

                    <h3>Guerilla Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p>I conducted usability test with 5 people in Toronto and Montreal and asked them to perform few
                        predefined tasks in the iOS
                        app. I mainly approached my friends and families. Since it was a lockdown due to Covid-19
                        pandemic,
                        I took the interview using facebook messenger,
                        used it's video chat and screen share facility to record participants' actions and took
                        notes.Some
                        of
                        the tasks/questions were:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What are the tasks you usually perform when you use a clothing retailer's app?</li>
                        <li>What do you want to see first as you open the app?</li>
                        <li>Browse and add a product of your choice in your cart.</li>
                        <li>Find out what's on sale ,new arrivals, store location, your order history, and size chart.
                        </li>
                        <li>Change notification settings.</li>
                        <li>Check if you have a discount/coupon.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This is what users said during the usability tests:</p>

                    <ul class="quotes">
                        <li>Why everything is so clumpsy?</li>

                <p>Participants particularly faced the following difficulties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigation through "Home" tab.</li>
                    <li>Browsing product categories.</li>

                    have organized
                    their app, and what are the features missing in current Uniqlo's app. </p>

            <div class="subSection">
                <h3>1. Rearrange the Tab Bar</h3>
                <p>Currently, there is 4 tabs in the tab bar i.e. "Home", "Wishlist", "Scan" and "Membership"
                    which I have
                    rearranged following ways for better user experience. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I added 2 new tabs i.e. "Shop", "More";</li>
                    <li>Users were confused with the tab name of "Membership". So, I changed it to "Profile";</li>
                    <li>I relocated "Scan" icon from the tab bar to the top, just above the search bar for the following
                        reason:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I wanted to make room for more important use cases in the tab bar;</li>
                            <li>It makes more sense, if scan and search bar is close to each other;</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>2. Change Layout of "Home"</h3>
                <p>Currently, the "Home" tab looks cluttered and messy. During the usability test,users seemed lost
                    while
                    they were navigating through home page. So, I changed its entire layout to give it a cleaner look.

            <!-- add shop tab -->
            <div class="subSection">
                <h3>3. Add "Shop" Tab</h3>
                <p>In current app structure, if users want to browse products there are two options available. One, they
                    have to search the product category in search bar on the top. Two, they have to scroll down to find
                    out the categories. As per my analysis, including all sub-categories i.e. outwear, tops, bottoms in
                    the "Home" tab is making the UI more cluttered. So, I added a new tab named "Shop" in the tab bar
                    and relocated all sub-categories there so
                    that users
                    have easier, cleaner
                    and quick access to the product categories.</p>

                <p>Also, I made the following changes in the subcategories:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Moved Sale, New Arrival to the top</li>
                    <li>Added two subcategories i.e. "Bestseller", "Clearance"</li>

                <p class="redesignCaption">How "Shop" tab has been designed from portion of "Home" tab's content</p>

            <!-- Change membership to profile -->
            <div class="subSection">
                <h3>4. From "Membership" to Profile</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>During usability test, participants were confused with the name "Membership". As per their
                        mental model, participants were looking
                        for "account/profile"
                        when they were asked to perform some use cases such as change your address, see your order
                        history, check if your
                        have a coupon. So, I changed the icon name to "Profile"</li>
                    <li>As per the current app structure, a user has to click the cart/ add something to the cart to get
                        into the log in/sign up page. Otherwise, there is no direct access to log in/ sign up.
                        So, I added "Sign In" and "Create An
                        Account" button in "Profile"</li>
                    <li>Participants had difficulty distiguishing between "Order History" and "Purchase History" as they
                        mentioned both of them sounds similar to them. So, I changed the name to "Online Orders" and
                        "In-store Shopping"</li>

                <h3>5. Add "More" Tab</h3>
                <p> I added a new icon in tab bar named "More. Whereas "Profile" icon is all about a user information,
                    "More" icon is all about Uniqlo's information and getting connected with it.As per my analysis, the
                    current app structure falls behind in providing information about helping/ supporting users. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I noticed there is no information available about their customer care. So, I included a "Contact
                        Us" option.</li>
                    <li>The other information for help and support such as "FAQ" is in "Membership" tab, which was time
                        consuming to find. So, I moved those under "More" tab so that all information source for helping
                        users are grouped together.</li>
                    <li>Though available in web version, there is no information about Uniqlo's social media account.For

                I used Invision to create a functional prototype of all the screens. Check it out <a

            <p>
                To validate the changes I made, I tested the prototype with 3 participants (1/3 participants were same
                who participated in first usability test). I asked the same questions from
                my initial tests and recorded their behavior and feedback.

    <!-- Validation -->

    <section>
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>
                The Results
            </h2>
            <p>
                As a result of the redesign, the success rate for tasks increased to 100% for all use cases except 1
                participants had difficulty browsing product categories in "Shop" tab. Some comments were:
            </p>

            <ul class="quotes">
                <li>What is Airism?</li>
                <li>Fleece should be under jacket section right?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Though the "Shop" tab was visually pleasant, after the validation testing I felt there is still
                opprtunity to optimize the content. So, I made a separate sub-category named "Featured Item" and
                included "Airism",
                "Heattech", "Fleece", "3D Knit", "UV Protection", "Special Collaboration" under this sub-category. Here
                is the glimpse of final version of information architecture.</p>
