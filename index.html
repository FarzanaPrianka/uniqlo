                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Uniqlo is a Japanese clothing retailer and manufacturer reknown for its affordable and
                        comfortable
                        product line. Ever since I came to Canada, I have been very fond of their clothings. I am
                        usually
                        Uniqlo's in-store shopper. But since the pandemic hits, I have been avoiding all in-store visit
                        and switched to online shopping . Couple of months ago, I tried to use Uniqlo's iOS app for the
                        first
                        time to order some activewear. As a user, I found the user interface difficult to
                        navigate
                        and as a designer , I found many flaws. To soothe my designer soul, I wanted to dig deeper and
                        take
                        the opportunity to redesign the user interface.
                    </p>

                    <p>The project is completely unsolicited and the goal was to identify any
                        usability issues and facilitate a better
                        user experience for Uniqlo's iOS app.

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <h3>Guerilla Usability Testing</h3>
                <p>I surveyed 5 people in Toronto and Montreal and asked them to perform few predefined tasks in the iOS
                    app. Since it was a lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic, I took the interview using facebook messenger
                    and
                    used it's video chat and screen share facility to record participants' actions and took notes.Some
                    of
                    the tasks/questions were:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Browse and add a product of your choice in your cart.</li>
                    <li>What do you want to see first as you open the app?</li>
                    <li>Find out what's on sale?</li>
                    <li>Find out the new arrivals.</li>
                    <li>Find the store locations on Uniqlo.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to wishlist</li>
                    <li>Filter & sort the product</li>
                    <li>Find the size chart</li>
                    <li>Check the product </li>
                    <li>See your order history</li>
                    <li>Find if online order is available, what is the fee</li>
                    <li>Change notification settings</li>
                    <li>Check if you have a discount/coupon</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is what users said during the usability tests:</p>

                <ul class="quotes">
                    <li>Why everything is so clumpsy?</li>
                    <li>There are so many things. I am lost!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ideation & Prototyping</h3>
                <p>I scoped out the iOS app of leading fashion retailers in Canada which has good rating (above 4.5)
                    in
                    their app store. I made observations on which layouts worked best and sketched out possible
                    solutions on
                    paper for the main screens before committing to high fidelity designs.</p>

            <h2>UX Suggestions & Redesign</h2>

            <!-- Rearrange the tab bar -->
            <div>
                <h3>Rearrange the tab bar</h3>
                <p>Currently, there is 4 icons in the tab bar i.e. "Home", "Wishlist", "Scan" and "Membership"
                    which I have
                    rearranged following ways for better user experience. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I added 2 new icons i.e. "Shop", "More";</li>
                    <li>Users were confused with the icon name of "Membership". So, I changed it to "Profile";</li>
                    <li>I relocated "Scan" icon from the tab bar to the top, just above the search bar for the following
                        reason:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I wanted to make room for more important use cases in the tab bar;</li>
                            <li>It makes more sense, if scan and search bar is close to each other;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </div>

            <!-- Change Layout of "Home" -->
            <div>
                <h3>Change Layout of "Home"</h3>
                <p>Currently, the homepage looks cluttered and messy. During the usability test,users seemed lost while
                    they were navigating through home page. So, I changed its entire layout to give it a cleaner look.
                </p>
                <div><img src="styles/images/homeLayout_Before.png" alt="current layout of home page"></div>
                <div><img src="styles/images/homeRedesign.png" alt="how home page has been redesigned"></div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Add "Shop" Icon</h3>
                <p>In current app structure, if users want to browse products there are two options available. One, they
                    have to search the product category in search bar on the top. Two, they have to scroll down to find
                    out the categories. In my redesign, I added a new icon named "Shop" in the tab bar so that users
                    have
                    quick access to the product categories.</p>

                <p>Also, I made the following changes in the subcategories:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Moved Sale, New Arrival to the top</li>
                    <li>Added two subcategories i.e. "Bestseller", "Clearance"</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    <img src="styles/images/shopRedesign.png">
                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>From "Membership" to Profile</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>During usability test, participants were confused with the name "Membership". As per their
                        mental model, participants were looking
                        for "account/profile"
                        when they were asked to perform some use cases such as change your address, see your order
                        history, check if your
                        have a coupon. So, I changed the icon name to "Profile"</li>
                    <li>As per the current app structure, a user has to click the cart/ add something to the cart to get
                        into the log in/sign up page. Otherwise, there is no direct log in/ sign up options available
                        which is a major painpoint of using the app. So, I added "Sign In" and "Create An
                        Account" </li>
                    <li>Participants had difficulty distiguishing between "Order History" and "Purchase History" as they
                        mentioned both of them sounds similar to them. I changed the name to "Online Orders" and
                        "In-store Shopping"</li>

                </ul>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>"More" Icon</h3>
                <p> I added a new icon in tab bar named "More. Whereas "Profile" icon is all about a user information,
                    "More" icon is all about getting connected with Uniqlo.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Product Sub-Category and Details</h3>
                <p>I changed the layout of product sub-category and details page to make it more visually appealing and
                    easier to follow.</p>
